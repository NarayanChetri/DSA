what is string builder in string ??

Mutable: StringBuilder allows modification of character sequences after creation.

Efficient: More efficient than String for frequent string manipulations (like concatenation) since it doesn't create new objects on every change.

Common Methods:
append(): Adds text to the end.
insert(): Inserts text at a specified index.
reverse(): Reverses the sequence of characters.
delete(): Removes characters from the sequence.

No New Objects: Unlike String, StringBuilder modifies the same object in memory, reducing overhead.
