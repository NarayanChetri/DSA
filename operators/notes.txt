Here are the different types of operators in Java:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform basic arithmetic operations.
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `/` (Division)
   - `%` (Modulus)

2. **Relational (Comparison) Operators**: Compare two values.
   - `==` (Equal to)
   - `!=` (Not equal to)
   - `>` (Greater than)
   - `<` (Less than)
   - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
   - `<=` (Less than or equal to)

3. **Logical Operators**: Used to perform logical operations.
   - `&&` (Logical AND)
   - `||` (Logical OR)
   - `!` (Logical NOT)

4. **Bitwise Operators**: Perform bit-level operations.
   - `&` (Bitwise AND)
   - `|` (Bitwise OR)
   - `^` (Bitwise XOR)
   - `~` (Bitwise NOT)
   - `<<` (Left shift)
   - `>>` (Right shift)
   - `>>>` (Unsigned right shift)

5. **Assignment Operators**: Assign values to variables.
   - `=` (Assign)
   - `+=` (Add and assign)
   - `-=` (Subtract and assign)
   - `*=` (Multiply and assign)
   - `/=` (Divide and assign)
   - `%=` (Modulus and assign)

6. **Unary Operators**: Operate on a single operand.
   - `+` (Unary plus)
   - `-` (Unary minus)
   - `++` (Increment)
   - `--` (Decrement)
   - `!` (Logical NOT)

7. **Ternary Operator**: Short form of if-else statement.
   - `?:` (Condition ? value1 : value2)

8. **Instanceof Operator**: Checks if an object is an instance of a class.
   - `instanceof`

9. **Type Casting Operators**: Convert data from one type to another.
   - `(datatype)` (Type cast) e.g., `(int)`, `(double)`

10. **Shift Operators**: Shift bits left or right.
    - `<<` (Left shift)
    - `>>` (Right shift)
    - `>>>` (Unsigned right shift)
